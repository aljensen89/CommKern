\title{Communities by layer plot}
\usage{
community_plot(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a \code{spinglass_net} object created by \code{\link{hms}}}

\item{...}{additional arguments from other methods}
}
\value{
a \code{gtable} object
}
\description{
Generate a graphical representation of the communities and layers.
}
\details{
This is an ancillary function that creates the plots seen in the manuscript,
with a heatmap-style plot on the top panel, derived from a network adjacency
matrix, and a community assignment plot on the bottom panel, separated by
layer.

data(SBM_net)

# plot with max of one layer
